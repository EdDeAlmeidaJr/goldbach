# Goldbach's Conjecture

On 7 June 1742, the German mathematician Christian Goldbach wrote a letter to Leonhard Euler (letter XLIII)[6] in which he proposed the following conjecture:

```Every integer which can be written as the sum of two primes, can also be written as the sum of as many primes as one wishes, until all terms are units.```

He then proposed a second conjecture in the margin of his letter:

    Every integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of three primes.

He considered 1 to be a prime number, a convention subsequently abandoned.[1] The two conjectures are now known to be equivalent, but this did not seem to be an issue at the time. A modern version of Goldbach's marginal conjecture is:
